## 🛠️ Self-Hosting Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Supabase account and project
- NewsAPI key
- OpenRouter API key (for GPT access)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Neotastisch/HowCloseToWorldEnd.git
   cd HowCloseToWorldEnd
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up Supabase:
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Navigate to the SQL Editor
   - Copy and run the contents of `init.sql` to create the required tables

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Supabase Configuration
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

   # API Keys
   NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
   ```

   **Finding your Supabase credentials:**
   - **URL**: `https://[your-project-id].supabase.co`
   - **Anon Key**: Found in Project Settings → API → anon public key

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 📡 API Usage

The project provides a public API with rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP). API documentation is available at `/docs` when running the server.

Example endpoints:
- GET `/api/latest` - Get the latest probability data
- GET `/api/history` - Get historical probability data

## 🔧 Configuration

You can modify the following settings in `index.js`:
- Update interval (default: 6 hours)
- Rate limiting parameters
- Maximum history records
- Port number

## 📊 Analytics

The project uses Umami for anonymous usage statistics. You can:
- Disable analytics by removing the Umami script from `index.html`
- Replace it with your own analytics solution
- Self-host Umami
