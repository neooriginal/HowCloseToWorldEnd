## 🔧 **Deploy Your Own Doomsday Monitor**

> *"Knowledge is power, but knowledge of the end is the ultimate power."*

Want to run your own private threat assessment? Here's how to set up your personal early warning system:

### **Prerequisites for Survival**
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized deployment) **OR** Node.js v18+ (for local development)
- Supabase account (cloud database for when local infrastructure fails)
- NewsAPI key (your pipeline to global intelligence)
- OpenRouter API key (for GPT-4 powered threat analysis)

### **🐳 Docker Deployment (Recommended)**

> *"In the final moments, only the prepared survive."*

**One-Command Deployment - No Building Required!**

Uses pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry for instant deployment.

1. **Download the Configuration**
   ```bash
   curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neooriginal/HowCloseToWorldEnd/main/docker-compose.yml
   ```

2. **Set Your Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the same directory:
   ```env
   # Your Database of Doom
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

   # Intelligence Gathering APIs
   NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
   ```

3. **Initialize Your Database** 
   - Create a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project
   - Download and run the [`init.sql`](https://github.com/neooriginal/HowCloseToWorldEnd/blob/main/init.sql) script in your SQL Editor

4. **Deploy in Seconds**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

That's it! Your doomsday dashboard is live at `http://localhost:3000`

### **🛠️ Local Development Installation**

> *"Sometimes you need to see the code to believe the end is near."*

1. **Clone the Repository of Truth**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neooriginal/HowCloseToWorldEnd.git
   cd HowCloseToWorldEnd
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies** 
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Initialize the Database** 
   - Create a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project
   - Run the `init.sql` script in your SQL Editor
   - This creates the tables that will track humanity's demise

4. **Configure Your Intelligence Network**
   Create `.env` with your secret credentials:
   ```env
   # Your Database of Doom
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

   # Intelligence Gathering APIs
   NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key
   ```

5. **Launch the Warning System**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Your personal doomsday dashboard will be live at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📡 **API: For Those Who Code at the Edge of Tomorrow**

> *"In the face of extinction, data becomes the most precious resource."*

Access the threat data programmatically:

- **GET `/api/countries`** - Current threat levels by nation
- **GET `/api/conflicts`** - Active global conflicts and crises  
- **GET `/api/global-analysis`** - Latest AI assessment of world end probability
- **GET `/docs`** - Complete API documentation

**Rate Limited**: 100 requests per 15 minutes (because even in the apocalypse, we need order)

## ⚠️ **Reality Check**

> *"The real question is not whether machines think but whether men do."* - B.F. Skinner

**How Close To World End** is an educational project that uses AI to analyze current events and generate speculative assessments. This is:

- ✅ **A powerful tool** for understanding global risk patterns
- ✅ **Educational content** about geopolitical threats
- ✅ **A technological demonstration** of AI-powered analysis
- ❌ **NOT a definitive prediction** of actual world-ending events
- ❌ **NOT investment advice** (though maybe invest in bunkers?)
- ❌ **NOT a reason to panic** (but maybe a reason to pay attention)
